1. Navigate to the "Select Courses" tab and select the file containing the readable Master Schedule CSV and load it.

2. Select your desired off periods. These are the off periods that you _like, totally need_. Depending on your situation, this could either be just your lunch period or your lunch period and another off that you'd like. If you have a one-and-a-half period class like AP Biology, do not treat the half period as a desired off period. If you select fewer off periods than the maximum possible, like if you only selected Period 5 but you have space for two off periods, the program will wildcard the remaining off periods.
