### Usage

1. Navigate to the "Select Courses" tab and select the file containing the readable Master Schedule CSV (you just downloaded this) and load it.

2. Select your desired off periods. These are the off periods that you _like, totally need_. Depending on your situation, this could either be just your lunch period or your lunch period and another off that you'd like. If you have a one-and-a-half period class like AP Biology, do not treat the half period as a desired off period. If you select fewer off periods than the maximum possible, like if you only selected Period 5 but you have space for two off periods, the program will wildcard the remaining off periods.

### Help

I can't figure out how to select multiple courses in the same box  
- Hold CTRL and click  

Can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer
- Try opening terminal and going to wherever you downloaded the .jar with `cd [Path to folder where .jar was saved]`. Run it directly with `java -jar ScheduleStacker_v1.2.0.jar`

It doesn't WORK!  
- Contact me with whatever issues you're experiencing. I want to help!
