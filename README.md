# ScheduleStacker

ScheduleStacker is tool designed for finding permutations of courses to aid in registration. It's a remake of a tool that I created last year, MasterScheduler.

I would love to give more information but there's really nothing to be said before significant progress is made. Also I can't think of anything.
